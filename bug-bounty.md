# Uniswap V3 Bug Bounty

## Overview

Starting on January 19rd, 2025, the [investmentpolls-token](https://github.com/InvestmentPools/investmentpolls-token) repository is subject to the InvestmentPools Bug Bounty (the “Program”) to incentivize responsible bug disclosure.

We are limiting the scope of the Program to critical and high severity bugs, and are offering a reward in IPS tokens. Happy hunting!

All reward decisions, including eligibility for and amounts of the rewards and the manner in which such rewards will be paid, are made at our sole discretion.
